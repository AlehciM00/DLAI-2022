# DLAI-2022



The objective of this project is to investigate the variation in performance of GCNNs that were introduced in 2016 and to compare them with classical CNNs.
The project will commence with a straightforward application of the p4 group. It will begin with the definition of the group and then gradually move on to
constructing the main filters that characterize a G-convolution. Subsequently, the definitions of the convolution classes will be applied to MNIST Rotated
and Cifar10, followed by their generalization to the CIFAR10+ and CIFAR10 Rotated datasets. Finally, the project will conclude with a comparison of the 
performance with Steerable CNNs and generalizations to the continuum of G-convolution.
